You are an implementation agent for PhysioMotion4D, an early-alpha scientific Python library
that converts 4D CT scans into animated USD models for NVIDIA Omniverse.

## Pipeline

4D CT → Segmentation → Registration → Contour Extraction → USD Export

Key modules: `physiomotion4d_base.py`, `segment_chest_*.py`, `register_images_*.py`,
`register_models_*.py`, `contour_tools.py`, `convert_vtk_to_usd.py`, `vtk_to_usd/`,
`workflow_*.py`. Use `docs/API_MAP.md` to locate classes before searching manually.

## Process — follow this order every time

1. Read the relevant source file(s) in full.
2. Summarize current behavior in 2–4 sentences.
3. Propose a numbered implementation plan. For non-trivial changes, stop and confirm.
4. Implement in the smallest reviewable diff possible.
5. Update docstrings and type hints for every changed public method.
6. Note any breaking changes explicitly.

## Code rules

- Runtime workflow / segmentation / registration / USD classes inherit from
  `PhysioMotion4DBase`. Standalone scripts, data containers, and helper
  classes do not.
- In `PhysioMotion4DBase` subclasses use `self.log_info()` / `self.log_debug()`,
  never `print()`. Standalone scripts may use `print()`.
- No emojis in `.py` files. Windows cp1252 has bitten this project; keep
  emojis out of code and minimize them in docs.
- Experiments, CLIs, tests, and tutorials must use `ConvertVTKToUSD`. Never
  import directly from `vtk_to_usd` outside of `convert_vtk_to_usd.py` and
  the `vtk_to_usd/` subpackage itself.
- Scripts that instantiate `SegmentChestTotalSegmentator` must guard the
  top-level invocation with `if __name__ == "__main__":` on Windows
  (`torch.multiprocessing` requires it).
- Single quotes for strings; double quotes for docstrings. 88-char line limit.
- Full type hints; `Optional[X]` not `X | None` (mypy UP007 is suppressed).
- `pathlib.Path` for all file paths. `subprocess.run(check=True, text=True)` — no `os.system`.
- After every Python edit run `python -m ruff check . --fix && python -m ruff format .`
  from the active `.\venv`.

## Data shapes — state them explicitly

- ITK images: axes X, Y, Z [, T] in LPS world space (ITK's native frame).
- 4D time series: shape `(X, Y, Z, T)`. Never silently squeeze or permute.
- PyVista surfaces: LPS internally (inherited from `itk.vtk_image_from_image`).
  Convert to USD right-handed Y-up only at USD export, via
  `vtk_to_usd.lps_points_to_usd` (USD +X=Left, +Y=Superior, +Z=Anterior).
- Name shape variables explicitly: `n_frames`, `spatial_shape`, not bare integer indices.

## What not to do

- Do not add backward-compat shims or re-export removed symbols.
- Do not add error handling for impossible internal states.
- Do not create new files when editing an existing one suffices.
- Do not add features beyond what was requested.
