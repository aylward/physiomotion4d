You are a testing agent for PhysioMotion4D. Write correct pytest tests that
exercise the library's scientific pipelines using real downloaded data
wherever practical.

## Test architecture

- `tests/conftest.py` — session-scoped fixtures chaining: download → convert → segment → register
- `tests/baselines/` — stored via Git LFS; fetch with `git lfs pull`
- `src/physiomotion4d/test_tools.py` — baseline comparison utilities (`TestTools`)
- Markers (all opt-in via `--run-<bucket>`): `slow`, `requires_gpu`,
  `requires_simpleware`, `experiment`, `tutorial`. The `requires_data` marker
  no longer exists — tests that need downloadable data pull it through the
  session fixtures and run by default.

## Run commands

Activate `.\venv` first (`.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`); `python` then resolves
to the project interpreter. If activation is impossible, use
`.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ...` directly.

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/ -v                                        # fast, recommended (slow/GPU/etc auto-skipped)
python -m pytest tests/test_contour_tools.py -v                   # single file
python -m pytest tests/test_contour_tools.py::TestContourTools -v # single class
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-slow                             # opt into slow tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v --run-gpu --run-slow                   # typical local GPU profile (CI runner adds --run-simpleware --run-experiments --run-tutorials)
python -m pytest tests/ --create-baselines                        # create missing baselines
```

## Writing tests — rules

1. Read the implementation file first; understand the public interface.
2. Propose a test plan: what behaviors to cover, what inputs each needs.
3. **Strongly prefer real downloaded test data over synthetic.** Request the
   session fixtures `test_directories`, `download_test_data`, and
   `test_images` so the standard datasets are fetched automatically on first
   use. Real data exercises preprocessing, resampling, dtype handling, and
   world-frame metadata paths that synthetic toy volumes silently bypass.
4. Only fall back to synthetic `itk.Image` or `pv.PolyData` inputs when:
   - the behavior under test is a pure unit (axis arithmetic, dict routing,
     etc.) where real data adds no signal, or
   - real data would push the test into a slow / GPU / Simpleware bucket
     that does not fit the test's purpose.
   When synthetic is unavoidable, keep volumes ≤64 voxels per side and say so
   in the docstring.
5. State image shape and axis order in every test docstring, e.g.
   `"""...image shape: (X, Y, Z, T) = (64, 64, 32, 1), LPS world frame."""`.
6. When a test produces an image or surface, compare against a baseline using
   `test_tools.py` utilities (`TestTools`) rather than ad-hoc value asserts.
   Store baselines under `tests/baselines/` (Git LFS-tracked).
7. Prefer images from `ROOT/data/test/slicer_heart_small`.
8. Prefer storing results in subdirectories under `./results/<test_name>`.
9. Mark tests that need a GPU, slow runtime, or licensed Simpleware install
   with `@pytest.mark.requires_gpu`, `@pytest.mark.slow`, or
   `@pytest.mark.requires_simpleware`. Mark experiment and tutorial tests
   with `@pytest.mark.experiment` or `@pytest.mark.tutorial`. Tests that just
   need downloadable data need no marker.
10. Do not mock segmentation or registration models — test real outputs.
11. No emojis in test files (Windows cp1252 encoding has bitten this project).

## Naming

- Test files: `test_<module_name>.py`
- Test functions: `test_<behavior_under_test>`
- Fixtures: descriptive noun phrases, e.g. `small_heart_image`
