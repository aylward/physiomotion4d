Architecture Overview
=====================

PhysioMotion4D is an early-beta scientific Python package built from workflow
classes plus reusable segmentation, registration, geometry, image, and USD
components. Runtime classes inherit from :class:`PhysioMotion4DBase` for
logging and consistent configuration.

Workflow Classes
================

``WorkflowConvertImageToUSD``
   Orchestrates 4D CT loading, segmentation, image registration, contour
   transformation, and animated USD generation.

``WorkflowConvertImageToVTK``
   Converts one 3D image into labeled VTK surface and voxel-mesh outputs.

``WorkflowCreateStatisticalModel``
   Builds a PCA statistical shape model from aligned population meshes.

``WorkflowFitStatisticalModelToPatient``
   Applies a template or PCA model to patient surfaces with model-registration
   stages.

``WorkflowReconstructHighres4DCT``
   Reconstructs high-resolution 4D CT frames using time-series registration to
   a fixed high-resolution reference.

``WorkflowConvertVTKToUSD``
   Wraps VTK-to-USD conversion for repository workflows and CLI use.

Key Boundaries
==============

Image processing uses ITK images in LPS world space. Surface and volume meshes
use PyVista/VTK and inherit that LPS frame. USD export converts those meshes to
OpenUSD and applies the repository's LPS-to-USD-Y-up transform at the
VTK-to-USD boundary.

The installed CLI commands are thin wrappers around these workflow classes.
They are the best executable references for supported API usage.
