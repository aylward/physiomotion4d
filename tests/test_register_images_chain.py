"""Unit tests for RegisterImagesChain's sequencing and state-propagation.

These are pure plumbing tests using stub RegisterImagesBase subclasses -
no real registration is performed. RegisterImagesChain composes independent
backends that may each need different intensity preprocessing, so the
chain's job is dict/attribute routing, not numeric accuracy; per this
project's testing conventions, that's exactly the kind of behavior
appropriate for synthetic/stub-based unit tests rather than real data.
