# Experiment Tests Guide

This guide explains how to use the automated test suite for PhysioMotion4D experiment notebooks.

## Overview

The `test_experiments.py` module provides automated testing for all Jupyter notebooks in the `experiments/` directory. Each subdirectory gets its own test that executes all notebooks in alphanumeric order.

⚠️ **WARNING:** These tests are **EXTREMELY LONG-RUNNING** and may take multiple hours to complete.

🔒 **PROTECTION:** Experiment tests are **opt-in only**. They will NOT run with standard pytest commands like `pytest tests/` or `pytest -v tests/`. You must explicitly pass the `--run-experiments` flag to run them.

## Quick Start

### List Available Experiments

```bash
# See all notebooks that would be run (without executing)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_list_notebooks_in_subdir -v -s --run-experiments

# Validate experiment directory structure
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_structure -v --run-experiments
```

### Run All Experiment Tests

```bash
# Run ALL experiments (may take many hours!)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -v --run-experiments

# Or run with marker filter (also works)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -v -m experiment --run-experiments
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Experiment tests require the `--run-experiments` flag to run. Without this flag, they will be automatically skipped.

### Run Individual Experiments

```bash
# Colormap VTK to USD (~2 hours)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_colormap_vtk_to_usd -v -s --run-experiments

# Reconstruct 4D CT (~4 hours, requires GPU)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_reconstruct_4dct -v -s --run-experiments

# Heart VTK Series to USD (~3 hours, requires data)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_heart_vtk_series_to_usd -v -s --run-experiments

# Heart Gated CT to USD (~6 hours, requires GPU & data)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_heart_gated_ct_to_usd -v -s --run-experiments

# Convert VTK to USD (~2 hours, requires data)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_convert_vtk_to_usd -v -s --run-experiments

# Create Statistical Model (~3 hours, requires data, includes manual steps)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_create_statistical_model -v -s --run-experiments

# Heart Statistical Model to Patient (~4 hours, requires GPU & data)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_heart_statistical_model_to_patient -v -s --run-experiments

# Lung Gated CT to USD (~6 hours, requires GPU & data)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_lung_gated_ct_to_usd -v -s --run-experiments

# DISABLED (notebooks not ready):
# - test_experiment_displacement_field_to_usd
# - test_experiment_lung_vessels_airways
```

⚠️ **NOTE:** All experiment tests require the `--run-experiments` flag. Without it, they are automatically skipped.

**Note:** Disabled tests are commented out in the code and will not run. They can be re-enabled when the notebooks are ready.

### Execution Order

Within each subdirectory, notebooks are executed in **alphanumeric order**:
- `0-download_and_convert_4d_to_3d.ipynb` (runs first)
- `1-register_images.ipynb` (runs second)
- `2-generate_segmentation.ipynb` (runs third)
- etc.

This ensures that notebooks with dependencies run in the correct sequence.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **CPU:** Multi-core processor (8+ cores recommended)
- **RAM:** 32GB minimum (64GB recommended for VISTA-3D experiments)
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (RTX 3090 or better recommended)
- **Disk:** 100GB+ free space for data and outputs
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+) or Windows 10/11

### Software Requirements

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pip install -e ".[test]"

# Or with uv (recommended)
uv pip install -e ".[test]"
```

### Data Requirements

Some experiments require external data downloads:
- Heart experiments: Slicer-Heart-CT dataset (~1.2GB)
- Lung experiments: DirLab 4DCT dataset (varies by case)

Data is typically downloaded automatically by the first notebook in each sequence.

## Test Markers

All experiment tests are marked with:

- `@pytest.mark.experiment` - Identifies as experiment test (excludes from CI/CD)
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Indicates long-running test
- `@pytest.mark.requires_gpu` - Requires CUDA-capable GPU (when applicable)
- `@pytest.mark.requires_data` - Requires external data download (when applicable)
- `@pytest.mark.timeout(seconds)` - Sets maximum execution time

## Running as Test: PHYSIOMOTION_RUNNING_AS_TEST

When you run experiment tests with `pytest ... --run-experiments`, the test runner sets the environment variable **`PHYSIOMOTION_RUNNING_AS_TEST=1`** before executing each notebook. Notebooks can read this to use **reduced parameters** (fewer iterations, fewer files, smaller resolution) so test runs complete in reasonable time.

### How it works

- **Test runner** ([test_experiments.py](test_experiments.py)): `execute_notebook()` passes `env` with `PHYSIOMOTION_RUNNING_AS_TEST=1` to the subprocess that runs `jupyter nbconvert --execute`, so the notebook kernel sees the variable.
- **Notebooks**: In an early cell (e.g. after imports or with other config), compute a boolean and use it to choose quick vs full parameters.

### Recommended check in notebooks

Use either of these:

**Option 1 – inline (no extra import):**

```python
running_as_test = os.environ.get("PHYSIOMOTION_RUNNING_AS_TEST", "").lower() in ("1", "true", "yes")
```

**Option 2 – shared helper (recommended):**

```python
from physiomotion4d.notebook_utils import running_as_test

# Then use running_as_test() where you need it, e.g.:
quick_run = running_as_test()
max_iterations = 100 if running_as_test() else 2000
```

### Semantics

- **Truthy values** (case-insensitive): `1`, `true`, `yes` → notebook should use fast/small parameters.
- **Unset or falsy**: use full parameters (normal interactive or production run).

Notebooks that support this will run quickly when executed as tests and at full fidelity when run manually.

## Usage Tips

### Run with Detailed Output

```bash
# Show all output from notebooks (recommended)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_heart_gated_ct_to_usd -v -s
```

The `-s` flag shows all stdout/stderr, including:
- Notebook execution progress
- Cell outputs
- Error messages
- Execution summaries

### Monitor Progress

Each notebook execution prints:
```
================================================================================
Executing notebook: 1-register_images.ipynb
Path: experiments/Heart-GatedCT_To_USD/1-register_images.ipynb
Timeout: 5400 seconds (90 minutes)
================================================================================

... (notebook output) ...

✅ Successfully executed: 1-register_images.ipynb
```

### Handle Failures

If a notebook fails:
1. Check the error output in the pytest summary
2. Open the notebook file to see execution results
3. Fix the issue (code, data, environment)
4. Re-run the specific test

The notebooks are executed **in place** (with `--inplace` flag), so execution results are saved in the notebook file.

### Skip Tests by Marker

```bash
# Skip GPU-dependent experiments
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -m "experiment and not requires_gpu" -v --run-experiments

# Skip data-dependent experiments
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -m "experiment and not requires_data" -v --run-experiments

# Run only fast experiments (relatively speaking!)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -m "experiment and not requires_gpu and not requires_data" -v --run-experiments
```

**Note:** The `--run-experiments` flag is always required, regardless of marker filters.

## CI/CD Exclusion

**These tests are NEVER run in CI/CD workflows.**

Experiment tests are protected by requiring the `--run-experiments` flag, which is never used in CI/CD. Even if someone accidentally runs:

```bash
# These commands will NOT run experiment tests (they'll be skipped)
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ -v -m experiment  # Still skipped without --run-experiments!
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -v  # Still skipped!
```

The ONLY way to run experiment tests is:

```bash
# This is the ONLY way experiment tests will run
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -v --run-experiments
```

This protection ensures experiment tests are:
- Never accidentally triggered in CI/CD
- Never run by developers doing normal testing
- Explicitly opt-in only for validation purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Test Timeout

If a test times out:
1. Check the timeout setting in the test function
2. Consider increasing it if needed:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.timeout(14400)  # 4 hours
   ```
3. Or override via command line:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_... -v --timeout=14400
   ```

### Out of Memory

If you get OOM errors:
1. Close other applications
2. Reduce batch sizes in notebooks (if applicable)
3. Use smaller test datasets
4. Consider running on a machine with more RAM

### GPU Not Available

If GPU tests fail due to CUDA issues:
1. Verify CUDA installation: `nvidia-smi`
2. Check PyTorch CUDA: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
3. Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support
4. Skip GPU tests: `-m "experiment and not requires_gpu"`

### Data Download Failures

If data downloads fail:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify URLs in notebooks are still valid
3. Manually download data and place in expected location
4. Check disk space

### Notebook Execution Errors

If individual cells fail:
1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab
2. Run cells manually to identify the issue
3. Check for:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Incorrect paths
   - Outdated APIs
   - Hardware limitations

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Timeouts

Edit `test_experiments.py` to adjust per-notebook or per-test timeouts:

```python
# Per-notebook timeout (default: 3600 seconds = 1 hour)
run_experiment_notebooks('Heart-GatedCT_To_USD', timeout_per_notebook=7200)

# Per-test timeout decorator
@pytest.mark.timeout(21600)  # 6 hours
def test_experiment_...():
    ...
```

### Adding New Experiments

To add a new experiment directory:

1. Create the subdirectory in `experiments/`
2. Add notebooks (use numeric prefixes for ordering)
3. Add to `EXPERIMENT_SUBDIRS` list in `test_experiments.py`:
   ```python
   EXPERIMENT_SUBDIRS = [
       'Colormap-VTK_To_USD',
       'YourNewExperiment',  # Add here
       ...
   ]
   ```
4. Create a test function:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.experiment
   @pytest.mark.slow
   @pytest.mark.timeout(7200)
   def test_experiment_your_new_experiment():
       """Test YourNewExperiment notebooks."""
       run_experiment_notebooks('YourNewExperiment', timeout_per_notebook=3600)
   ```

### Parallel Execution

⚠️ **Use with caution** - Experiments use significant GPU/CPU resources.

You can run multiple experiment subdirectories in parallel using pytest-xdist:

```bash
# Run with multiple workers (different subdirectories run in parallel)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -v -n 2 --run-experiments

# Run with auto-detection of CPU count
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -v -n auto --run-experiments
```

**IMPORTANT GUARANTEES:**
- ✅ Notebooks **within** each subdirectory run **SEQUENTIALLY** in alphanumeric order
- ✅ Different subdirectories **CAN** run in parallel (if resources allow)
- ✅ Each test function is atomic - pytest-xdist won't split notebook execution
- ✅ `@pytest.mark.xdist_group` markers prevent conflicts if needed
- ✅ Execution stops on first failure within each subdirectory

**Example:**
```bash
# With -n 2, these could run simultaneously:
# Worker 1: test_experiment_colormap_vtk_to_usd
# Worker 2: test_experiment_heart_vtk_series_to_usd

# But within Worker 1's test, notebooks run in strict order:
# 1. colormap_vtk_to_usd.ipynb (must complete first)
# ... (any subsequent notebooks in that directory)
```

## FAQ

**Q: How long will all experiments take?**
A: Approximately 32 hours total on a high-end workstation (GPU, 64GB RAM). Note: DisplacementField_To_USD and Lung-VesselsAirways are currently disabled.

**Q: Can I run these on CPU only?**
A: Some experiments will work, but most require GPU and will be extremely slow or fail on CPU.

**Q: Will these tests modify the notebooks?**
A: Yes, notebooks are executed in-place. Execution results are saved in the notebook files.

**Q: Should I commit notebook outputs?**
A: Depends on your workflow. Consider using `nbstripout` to clean outputs before committing.

**Q: What if I only want to test specific notebooks?**
A: The test suite runs all notebooks in a subdirectory. To test individual notebooks, run them manually in JupyterLab.

**Q: Can I use these tests for regression testing?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to add output validation. Currently, tests only check that notebooks execute without errors.

**Q: Are these tests deterministic?**
A: Not always - some experiments use random seeds, AI models, or external data that may change.
