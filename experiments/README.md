### `Reconstruct4DCT` - High-Resolution 4D Reconstruction

**What it demonstrates:** Generates high-resolution 4D sequences by registering a
high-resolution 3D scan with a low-resolution 4D sequence and upsampling. Critical for
obtaining finer details in 4D data used to train AI motion simulations.

**Key technologies:**
- GPU-accelerated ICON registration (inverse consistent)
- Traditional ANTs registration library
- CT-appropriate tissue mass-preserving metric (optional)

**Adaptation potential:** This approach can be fine-tuned for:
- Different anatomical regions (abdomen, pelvis, extremities)
- Alternative imaging modalities (MRI, ultrasound time series)
- Custom registration metrics for specific tissue types
- Multi-phase imaging protocols beyond respiratory/cardiac gating

### `Lung-GatedCT_To_USD` and `Heart-GatedCT_To_USD` - Complete 4D CT Pipelines

**What they demonstrate:** End-to-end pipelines from 4D CT reconstruction through
segmentation, meshing, USD conversion, and tissue property assignment for Omniverse
visualization and manipulation.

**Pipeline stages:**
1. 4D CT reconstruction (using methods from `Reconstruct4DCT`)
2. AI segmentation (TotalSegmentator, Vista3D/Clara Segment Open Model as NIM or local)
3. Per-organ mesh generation
4. OpenUSD conversion with animation
5. Tissue property mapping (subsurface scatter, color, etc.)

**Adaptation potential:** Highly modular design enables:
- New anatomical regions (brain, spine, joints, abdominal organs)
- Custom segmentation models and label schemas
- Alternative meshing strategies (higher/lower resolution, topology optimization)
- Domain-specific tissue property mappings for different visualization needs
- Integration with Isaac for Healthcare "Bring-Your-Own-Data" workflows
- Multi-organ system digital twins for surgical planning

### `Heart-VTKSeries_To_USD` - VTK to USD Conversion

**What it demonstrates:** Direct conversion from VTK time series representations to
OpenUSD, preserving colormaps and visualization properties where possible.

**Use cases:**
- Leveraging existing VTK-based medical imaging applications in Omniverse
- Accessing Omniverse connectors (PyAnsys, ROS/ROS2, Isaac for Healthcare)
- Enhanced AR/VR visualization beyond traditional medical imaging viewers
- Integration with physics simulation engines
- Surgical robot training environments

**Adaptation potential:**
- Custom VTK property to USD material mappings
- Support for additional VTK data structures (polydata, unstructured grids)
- Pipeline integration for real-time or near-real-time visualization
- Domain-specific colormap standards (ultrasound Doppler, functional imaging)

**Note:** VTK-to-USD mapping is complex and may require refinement for specific use cases.
This experiment provides a foundation to build upon.

### `Heart-Create_Statistical_Model` - Statistical Shape Model Generation with PCA

**What it demonstrates:** Creating a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) statistical shape
model from a population of anatomical meshes using the KCL Heart Model dataset and SlicerSALT.

**Key benefit:** Statistical shape models capture natural anatomical variation and enable:
- Patient-specific model fitting with anatomically plausible constraints
- Population-based shape analysis and hypothesis testing
- Efficient parameterization of complex 3D anatomy
- Data augmentation for AI training with realistic shape variations

**Technologies:**
- Population mesh alignment and preprocessing
- **SlicerSALT** for interactive correspondence computation (manual steps)
- **SlicerSALT** for PCA analysis (manual steps)
- VTK/ITK for mesh and image processing
- Template mask generation for registration

**Pipeline stages:**
1. Convert volumetric meshes to surfaces (automated)
2. Align population meshes (automated)
3. Compute point correspondences (manual - SlicerSALT)
4. Prepare PCA inputs (automated)
5. Perform PCA analysis (manual - SlicerSALT)
6. Generate template mask (automated)

**Adaptation potential:** This workflow can be adapted to:
- Any anatomical structure (liver, brain, bones, organs)
- Multi-structure shape models (combined organ systems)
- Time-varying shape models (4D motion patterns)
- Disease-specific shape analysis (pathology vs. normal)
- Surgical planning with shape prediction

**⚠️ Required first**: Complete this experiment BEFORE `Heart-Statistical_Model_To_Patient`
as it generates the PCA model files needed for patient-specific registration.

**Output:** PCA model files (eigenvectors, eigenvalues, mean shape, template mask) for
use in patient registration workflows.

### `Heart-Statistical_Model_To_Patient` - Patient-Specific Digital Twin Registration

**What it demonstrates:** Fitting a simulation-ready or AI-ready anatomical model to
patient-specific imaging data, creating a consistent architecture across subjects. Uses
PCA statistical shape models to constrain deformation to anatomically plausible variations.

**Key benefit:** Using consistent model topology across patients dramatically improves
cross-patient robustness of AI models for physiological motion, enabling a single model
to handle diverse cases.

**Technologies:**
- ICP (Iterative Closest Point) registration for initial alignment
- Mask-based deformable registration for anatomical fitting
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) shape modeling for shape constraints
- Three-stage registration pipeline (ICP → Mask-to-Mask → Mask-to-Image)
- Computationally intensive (>1 hour on typical PC)

**Prerequisites:**
- Complete `Heart-Create_Statistical_Model` experiment first to generate PCA model
- Or use pre-computed PCA model from KCL dataset

**Adaptation potential:** This foundational approach can be extended to:
- Any anatomical structure with consistent topology (liver, brain, vessels)
- Multi-organ system models with coupled motion patterns
- Patient-specific biomechanics simulation preparation
- AI training datasets with normalized anatomical coordinates
- Population-based statistical shape modeling
- Real-time deformable registration for interventional guidance
- Integration with simulation engines (PyAnsys, FEniCS, etc.)

**Output:** Patient-specific USD models ready for physics simulation or AI training.

## Adapting to New Digital Twin Models and Tasks

These experiments illustrate architectural patterns and workflows that can be adapted
to new anatomical regions, physiological processes, and digital twin applications.

### General Adaptation Strategy

1. **Study the experiment conceptually** - Understand the workflow stages and data transformations
2. **Consult the CLI implementation** - See `src/physiomotion4d/cli/` to identify production classes and methods that implement similar functionality
3. **Identify customization points:**
   - Registration parameters (metrics, transforms, optimization)
   - Segmentation models (custom training, fine-tuning, label mappings)
   - Meshing parameters (resolution, smoothing, topology)
   - Tissue property mappings (visualization, physics parameters)
4. **Leverage modular design** - Swap components (registration algorithms, segmentation models) as needed
5. **Validate on your data** - Test with representative samples before production deployment

### Key Takeaway

These experiments are **starting points for exploration**, not copy-paste solutions.
The **CLI commands and implementations in `src/physiomotion4d/cli/`** are the production-quality
code you should use and extend for real-world digital twin projects.

## Automated Testing

A comprehensive test suite is available to validate all experiment notebooks:

```bash
# Run all experiment tests (EXTREMELY SLOW - may take hours)
# NOTE: Requires --run-experiments flag!
pytest tests/test_experiments.py -v --run-experiments

# Run a specific experiment subdirectory
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_heart_gated_ct_to_usd -v -s --run-experiments

# List all notebooks that would be run (without executing)
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_list_notebooks_in_subdir -v -s --run-experiments

# Validate experiment directory structure
pytest tests/test_experiments.py::test_experiment_structure -v --run-experiments
