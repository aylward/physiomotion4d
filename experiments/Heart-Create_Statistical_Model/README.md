# Heart-Create_Statistical_Model Experiment

This experiment demonstrates how to create a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) statistical shape model of a heart from a population of meshes using the KCL Heart Model dataset.

**IMPORTANT:** Users should complete this experiment BEFORE attempting the `Heart-Statistical_Model_To_Patient` experiment, as it generates the PCA model data required for patient-specific registration.

## Overview

Statistical shape models (SSMs) capture the natural variation in anatomy across a population. By using PCA on a set of aligned heart meshes, we can:
- Identify the principal modes of shape variation
- Generate new plausible heart shapes by varying PCA coefficients
- Register these models to patient-specific data for personalized digital twins

This experiment uses the **King's College London (KCL) four-chamber heart model dataset**, which provides 20 four-chamber heart models derived from CT images.

## Dataset

The experiment requires the **KCL-Heart-Model** dataset located in `data/KCL-Heart-Model/`.

### Manual Download Required

The KCL dataset is NOT automatically downloaded. You must manually download it from:

**[Virtual cohort of adult healthy four-chamber heart meshes from CT images](https://zenodo.org/records/4590294)**

See `data/KCL-Heart-Model/README.md` for complete download and setup instructions.

### Required Files

- 20 tetrahedral heart meshes (`.vtk` format)
- Mesh labels (chamber, valve, vessel identifiers)
- Optional: existing PCA results from the dataset authors

## Pipeline Overview

This experiment follows a fully automated multi-step process. Each step is a
`# %%` percent-cell Python script that can be run top-to-bottom with
`python <script>.py` or stepped through cell-by-cell in VS Code / Cursor.

### Automated Steps

1. **`1-input_meshes_to_input_surfaces.py`**
   - Converts volumetric tetrahedral meshes to surface representations
   - Extracts relevant anatomical surfaces for shape analysis
   - Prepares data for alignment

2. **`2-input_surfaces_to_surfaces_aligned.py`**
   - Performs initial rigid alignment of surfaces using ICP
   - Centers and orients meshes for consistent positioning
   - Computes and saves the average surface from aligned meshes
   - Prepares aligned data for correspondence computation

3. **`3-registration_based_correspondence.py`**
   - Establishes point correspondences across the population using Greedy affine + ICON deformable registration
   - Uses mask-based distance map registration via `RegisterModelsDistanceMaps`
   - Greedy affine pre-aligns masks; ICON deep learning refines with a deformable field
   - Critical step for meaningful PCA analysis

4. **`4-surfaces_aligned_correspond_to_pca_inputs.py`**
   - Converts corresponded surfaces to PCA input format
   - Prepares data matrices for statistical analysis
   - Validates correspondence quality

5. **`5-compute_pca_model.py`**
   - Computes PCA on the corresponded point sets using sklearn
   - Generates eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and explained variance
   - Exports complete PCA model to `pca_model.json`
   - Produces statistical shape model outputs

## Technical Approach

This experiment uses a fully automated approach combining:

### Registration-Based Correspondence

Instead of traditional mesh parameterization methods (e.g., SPHARM-PDM), this pipeline uses **deformable image registration** to establish correspondences:

- **Greedy affine** (PICSL Greedy) performs fast CPU-based affine pre-alignment
- **ICON deformable** applies deep learning registration on the affine-pre-aligned masks
- Distance maps from surface meshes create continuous fields for registration
- Mask-based approach focuses registration on anatomical structures

**Advantages:**
- Fully automated (no manual parameter tuning)
- Handles complex topologies naturally
- Composed Greedy + ICON transforms provide smooth, invertible deformation fields
- Integrates seamlessly with medical imaging pipelines

### PCA Computation

Statistical shape modeling uses **sklearn's PCA implementation**:
- Computes eigenvectors and eigenvalues from point correspondences
- Calculates explained variance for each mode
- Exports model in JSON format compatible with `RegisterModelsPCA` class

## Workflow

### 1. Download Data

See `data/KCL-Heart-Model/README.md` for download instructions. Place downloaded mesh files in `data/KCL-Heart-Model/input_meshes/`.

### 2. Run All Scripts in Sequence

```bash
cd experiments/Heart-Create_Statistical_Model/

# Execute scripts in order (each can also be stepped through cell-by-cell
# in VS Code or Cursor via the `# %%` cell markers):
python 1-input_meshes_to_input_surfaces.py     # Extract surfaces from volumetric meshes
python 2-input_surfaces_to_surfaces_aligned.py # Rigid ICP alignment + compute average
python 3-registration_based_correspondence.py  # Greedy affine + ICON deformable correspondence
python 4-surfaces_aligned_correspond_to_pca_inputs.py  # Prepare PCA input matrices
python 5-compute_pca_model.py                  # Compute PCA and export JSON model
```

**Total Runtime:** Approximately 1-3 hours depending on hardware (20 heart meshes; Greedy affine is fast on CPU, ICON requires a GPU for reasonable speed).

```python
from physiomotion4d import WorkflowFitStatisticalModelToPatient

# Use PCA model from this experiment
workflow = WorkflowFitStatisticalModelToPatient(
    moving_mesh=mean_shape,
    fixed_meshes=patient_surfaces,
    fixed_image=patient_ct,
    pca_json="pca_model.json",  # From this experiment
    pca_number_of_modes=10
)

registered_mesh = workflow.run_workflow()
```

## Requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Data Files
- Ensure KCL dataset is downloaded to `data/KCL-Heart-Model/input_meshes/`
- Check `data/KCL-Heart-Model/README.md` for download instructions
- Verify all 20 heart mesh files (`.vtk` format) are present

### Registration Taking Too Long
- Greedy affine is fast (< 1 minute per subject on CPU)
- ICON deformable is GPU-accelerated; without a GPU it falls back to CPU and will be significantly slower
- Total time for 20 subjects: 1-3 hours depending on GPU availability

### Memory Issues
- Close other applications to free RAM
- ICON can use 4-8GB GPU VRAM; reduce batch size or iterations if needed
- Process fewer meshes initially to test pipeline

### Correspondence Quality Issues
- Check alignment quality from step 2 (ICP should produce good initial alignment)
- Verify average surface looks reasonable before step 3
- If Greedy affine fails, check input mesh quality and topology
- If ICON deformable quality is poor, increase `icon_iterations` in the `register()` call

### Import Errors
- Ensure all PhysioMotion4D dependencies are installed
- Check Greedy is available: `python -c "from picsl_greedy import Greedy3D; print('ok')"`
- Reinstall environment if needed: `pip install -e .` in repository root
