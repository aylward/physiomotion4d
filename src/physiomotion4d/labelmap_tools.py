Labelmap Tools for PhysioMotion4D

This module provides the :class:`LabelmapTools` class with the definitive
utility for turning a multi-label (or binary) segmentation labelmap into a
binary registration mask, optionally excluding specific labels and dilating
the result by a physical radius in millimeters.

    """
    Utilities for converting segmentation labelmaps into registration masks.

    A labelmap is an ``itk.Image`` of integer labels where ``0`` is background
    and each positive value identifies an anatomical structure. A registration
    mask is a binary ``itk.Image`` where every foreground voxel is ``1``. This
    class centralizes the labelmap-to-mask conversion so that thresholding,
    label exclusion, and physically isotropic dilation are performed
    identically everywhere in the platform.

    Example:
        >>> tools = LabelmapTools()
        >>> # Binary mask of every labeled voxel, dilated 5 mm
        >>> mask = tools.convert_labelmap_to_mask(labelmap, dilation_in_mm=5.0)
        >>> # Exclude the table/background labels 8 and 9 before masking
        >>> mask = tools.convert_labelmap_to_mask(
        ...     labelmap, dilation_in_mm=5.0, exclude_labels=[8, 9]

        Any voxel whose label is in ``exclude_labels`` is set to background
        first; every remaining non-zero voxel becomes foreground (``1``). The
        binary mask is then dilated by ``dilation_in_mm`` millimeters of
        physical radius. The radius is converted into per-axis voxel counts
        from the labelmap's spacing so the dilation is physically isotropic
        even on anisotropic grids; each per-axis count is clamped to at least
        1 voxel when ``dilation_in_mm > 0``.

        Args:

                millimeters. Pass ``0`` (or negative) to skip dilation and

                to background before thresholding. When ``None`` (the default)
                no labels are excluded.

        Each output voxel holds its original integer label plus a small
        fractional offset that encodes how far the voxel lies from the nearest
        boundary between two differently-labeled regions:

            value = label + min(distance_to_nearest_boundary_mm,
                                max_distance_mm) / distance_scale

        The boundary set is every voxel that 6-neighbors a voxel with a
        different label (background label ``0`` participates, so the outer
        surface of each structure is a boundary). The unsigned physical
        distance from each voxel to that set is computed with
        ``SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter`` (taking the magnitude), clipped
        to ``max_distance_mm``, divided by ``distance_scale``, and added to the
        voxel's original label.

        With the defaults (``20`` mm clip, ``5`` scale) the fractional offset
        stays in ``[0.0, 4.0]``, potentially passing adjacent integer labels but
        emphasizing in medial alignment as well as boundary.

        The motivation is registration metrics such as Greedy's NCC: a raw
        integer labelmap is piecewise-constant, so the local variance inside
        each region is zero and NCC produces NaN gradients. Replacing it with
        this continuous encoding gives every region a smoothly varying signal
        while preserving label identity.

        Args:
            labelmap: Multi-label (or binary) ``itk.Image`` of integer labels.
            max_distance_mm: Distance clip, in millimeters. Default 20.0.
            distance_scale: Divisor applied to the clipped distance before it
                is added to the label. Default 5.0. With the default clip
                this bounds the fractional offset to ``[0, 4.0]``.

        Returns:
            ``itk.Image[itk.F, 3]`` in the same physical space as ``labelmap``
