"""Fine-tune uniGradICON registration and apply the fine-tuned weights.

This module provides :class:`WorkflowFineTuneICONRegistration`, which packages
the two halves of the longitudinal-registration ICON fine-tuning experiment
from ``experiments/LongitudinalRegistration``:

1. **Fine-tuning**: build a paired dataset JSON and YAML config from per-subject
   lists of image files (with optional labelmaps and landmark CSVs)
   and launch ``unigradicon.finetuning.finetune`` as a subprocess.  Mirrors
   ``experiments/LongitudinalRegistration/1-finetune_icon.py``.
2. **Apply**: load a fine-tuned uniGradICON checkpoint and register a list of
   moving images to a single reference image using
   :class:`RegisterTimeSeriesImages` (ICON backend).  Mirrors the per-subject
   registration loop in
   ``experiments/LongitudinalRegistration/recon_4d_icon_eval.py``.

Conventions:
    - Fine-tuning is file-based: it reads images/labelmaps/landmarks from disk
      because ``unigradicon.finetuning.finetune`` is launched as a subprocess
      that consumes JSON paths.
    - Apply is in-memory: takes ``itk.Image`` inputs in LPS space and
      ``dict[name, (x, y, z)]`` landmark dictionaries.  Segmentations are
      resampled with nearest-neighbor interpolation; images use linear
      interpolation.
    - The ``inverse_transform`` returned by ICON is a resampler-convention
      transform that maps moving-grid points back to reference-grid points;
      ``forward_transform`` is the inverse direction (reference grid →
      moving grid).  Landmarks are warped using ``TransformPoint`` and
      images/labelmaps are resampled via
      :meth:`TransformTools.transform_image`.

    """Fine-tune uniGradICON on paired 3D images and apply the fine-tuned weights.

    The workflow has two stages that can be used together or independently:

    **Stage 1: Fine-tuning** (file-based)
        Build a paired dataset JSON and YAML config from per-subject lists of
        image, labelmap, and landmark files, then launch
        ``unigradicon.finetuning.finetune`` as a subprocess.  Each subject's
        time-point images form one paired group (they share a ``subject_id``).

    **Stage 2: Apply** (in-memory)
        Register a list of moving images to a single reference image using the
        fine-tuned ICON weights and return both directions of the warp:

        - moving images / labelmaps / landmarks warped into reference space
        - the reference image / labelmap / landmarks warped into each
          moving-image space

    Attributes:
        subject_image_files (list[list[str]]): Per-subject lists of image
            paths.  Images within one inner list share a subject_id during
            fine-tuning.
        output_dir (Path): Directory where dataset JSON, YAML config, derived
            masks, and the uniGradICON ``checkpoints/`` tree are written.
        fine_tune_name (str): Sub-directory name for the experiment outputs.
        subject_ids (Optional[list[str]]): One ID per subject (e.g. patient
            identifiers).  Written into the dataset JSON's ``subject_id``
            field; falls back to synthetic ``subject_NNNN`` when ``None``.
        subject_labelmap_files (Optional[list[list[Optional[str]]]]):
            Per-subject multi-label labelmap paths aligned with
            ``subject_image_files``.  ``None`` (or per-image ``None``) means no
            labelmap for that image.  If supplied for at least one image,
            paired-with-seg training is enabled.
        subject_mask_files (Optional[list[list[Optional[str]]]]):
            Per-subject binary mask paths aligned with ``subject_image_files``.
            When supplied for a frame these masks are used directly for
            loss-function masking; otherwise masks are derived from
            ``subject_labelmap_files``.
        subject_landmark_files (Optional[list[list[Optional[str]]]]):
            Per-subject landmark CSV paths (``Name,X,Y,Z`` format) aligned with
            ``subject_image_files``.  Recorded in the dataset JSON for
            traceability; not consumed by uniGradICON fine-tuning itself.
        mask_dilation_mm (float): Millimeters of physical-radius binary
            dilation applied to the >0 labelmap when deriving the loss-masking
            binary mask via :meth:`LabelmapTools.convert_labelmap_to_mask`.
        mask_exclude_labels (Optional[list[int]]): Labels to exclude from the mask.
            Default is None.
        mask_dir (Optional[Path]): Directory where derived binary masks are
            written and looked up.  ``None`` (default) writes each derived
            mask next to its source labelmap on disk.
        registrar (RegisterTimeSeriesImages): ICON-backend registrar used in
            :meth:`apply_registration`.
        transform_tools (TransformTools): Utility for resampling images and
            labelmaps.

                are allowed.
            number_of_iterations: ICON fine-tuning iterations per registration.
            modality: Imaging modality passed through to the underlying ICON
