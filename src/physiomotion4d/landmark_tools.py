"""
Tools for reading and writing anatomical landmarks.

This module provides the :class:`LandmarkTools` class with utilities for
reading and writing point landmarks in 3D Slicer's Markups JSON
(``.mrk.json``) format and in a simple CSV format. Landmarks are kept in
memory in LPS world coordinates (ITK's native frame, matching the rest of
the platform). RAS files are converted to LPS on read; outputs are always
written in LPS.
